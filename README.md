# Transcription & Speaker Diarization-Compilation
 
## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook provides a comprehensive approach to transcribing audio content and performing speaker diarization using a combination of powerful modules. The key modules used in this notebook are:

Whisper: A cutting-edge automatic speech recognition (ASR) system developed by OpenAI.
Resemblyzer: A library for voice similarity analysis and speaker diarization.
Librosa: A Python package for music and audio analysis.
YouTube_DL: A tool for downloading YouTube videos and extracting audio content.
Datasets: A library for managing and accessing datasets.
Pydub: A high-level audio processing library.
SpectralCluster: A spectral clustering implementation for speaker diarization.

## Installation
Make sure to install the required modules before running the notebook. You can do this by executing the following commands:

### bash
Copy code
!pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git
!pip install Resemblyzer
!sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg
!pip install librosa
!pip install youtube_dl
!pip install datasets
!pip install pydub
!pip3 install spectralcluster

## Approach
The transcription and speaker diarization process involves several steps, each executed by different modules:

Data Collection: Utilize YouTube_DL to download audio content from YouTube videos or use your own audio files.

Speech Recognition: Leverage the power of Whisper for accurate automatic speech recognition, converting spoken words into text.

Feature Extraction: Use Librosa to extract relevant features from the audio, providing valuable information for speaker diarization.

Voice Embeddings: Employ Resemblyzer to generate voice embeddings, enabling the comparison and identification of speakers.

Speaker Diarization: Apply SpectralCluster for clustering speakers based on voice similarities, effectively separating speakers in the audio.

Post-processing: Utilize Pydub for additional audio processing tasks, enhancing the overall quality and clarity of the transcribed and diarized content.

## How to Use
Import the required modules.
Download or provide the audio content for transcription and speaker diarization.
Execute the notebook cells step by step, following the defined approach.
Review the output text and diarized audio to analyze the transcribed content and identified speakers.
